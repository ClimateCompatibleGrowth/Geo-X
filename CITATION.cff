  GeoH2 is a geospatial model that optimizes the cost of
  green hydrogen production, storage, transport, and
  conversion. This model calculates the cost of producing
  green hydrogen in a specified location to meet demand in
  another location by: (1) optimizing hydrogen conversion
  and transport from production site to demand site; and (2)
  optimizing green hydrogen production and storage based on
  spatially-specific wind and solar generation temporal
  availability. This method allows users to map production
  costs throughout a region to identify the lowest-cost
  location of green hydrogen production to meet demand using
  a specified end-state for transportation and storage
  (i.e., pressurized hydrogen, ammonia, or liquefied
  hydrogen). These modeled costs can be compared to current
  or projected prices for energy and chemical feedstock in
  the region to assess the cost-competitiveness of green
  hydrogen. The model is designed to run at a country or
  regional scale.
