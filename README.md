# Geo-X
**Geospatial analysis of commodity production costs**

Geo-X calculates the locational cost of production, storage, transport, and conversion of different commodities to meet demand in a specified location.
These costs can be compared to current or projected prices in the region under study to assess competitiveness. 
Currently, green hydrogen and green ammonia are implemented as commodities in Geo-X. 
However, the code is written in a modular way to allow further commodities to be implemented.

The model outputs the levelised cost (LC) of the specified commodity at the specified demand location including production, storage, transport, and conversion costs from each production location. 

In the code provided, the use case of hydrogen and ammonia production in Namibia is provided as an example.
Parameter references for the hydrogen case are attached.
However, as the code is written in a generalized way, it is possible to analyse all sorts of regions.

Geo-X builds upon a preliminary code iteration produced by Leander MÃ¼ller, available under a CC-BY-4.0 licence: [https://github.com/leandermue/GEOH2](https://github.com/leandermue/GEOH2).
It also integrates code produced by Nick Salmon under an MIT licence:

# Setup instructions

Follow the steps below before running Geo-X. 
Note that Geo-X is implemented using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
This lets you automate code execution using different "rules".
When we refer to rules below, we're just talking about running different parts of the codebase that execute different functionalities.

This installation requires Git for version control. If you don't have Git installed, please follow these [instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## 1) Clone the repository
First, clone the Geo-X repository using Git. 

`... % git clone https://github.com/ClimateCompatibleGrowth/Geo-X.git`

## 2) Set up the environment
The python package requirements are in the `environment.yaml` file. 
You can install these requirements in a new environment using the `mamba` package and environment manager (installation instructions [here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html)): 

` .../geo-x % mamba env create -f environment.yaml`

Then activate this new environment using:

`.../geo-x % mamba activate geox`

## 3) Get a Climate Data Store API key
To simulate commodities which use renewable energy for production, historical climate data is needed as an input.
The `get_weather_data` rule can be used to download the relevant data from the ERA-5 reanalysis dataset using [Atlite](https://atlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create a cutout. 
For this process to work, you need to register and set up your CDS API key as described on the [Climate Data Store website](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/how-to-api).

## 4) Install a solver
For the `plant_optimization` rule to work, you will need a solver installed on your computer. 
You can use any solver that works with [PyPSA](https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), such as [Cbc](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc), a free, open-source solver, or [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/), a commerical solver with free academic licenses available. 
Install your solver of choice following the instructions for use with Python and your operating system in the solver's documentation. 

> [!NOTE]
> Snakemake uses Cbc as a solver by default. This will be installed upon environment setup. To check that this is installed, activate your environment and enter `mamba list` in your terminal for the environment's list of packages. If you choose to use Cbc, no additional solver needs to be installed.

# Preparing input data

Next, you'll need to prepare input data. 
Geo-X has two types of input data: (1) spatial input data, and (2) techno-economic and plant parameters. If you want hydropower or geothermal as generators, you must include certain files; these are discussed in the next section.

## 1) Prepare input hexagons 
> [!NOTE]
> You will need to complete this step (and optional parts, if necessary) for every country you wish to create files for.

First, prepare spatial input data as a set of hexagons using the [H3 standard](https://h3geo.org/).
To analyse a different area of interest, the hexagon file needs to be changed, but needs to follow the logic of the one provided. 

A full walkthrough on making these hexagons, including tools to create them, are available in the [Geo-X-data-prep](https://github.com/ClimateCompatibleGrowth/Geo-X-data-prep) repository.
The hexagon file needs to have the following attributes:

  - waterbody_dist: Distance to selected waterbodies in area of interest
  - waterway_dist: Distance to selected waterways in area of interest
  - ocean_dist: Distance to ocean coastline
  - road_dist: Distance to road network
  - theo_pv: Theoretical potential of standardized PV plants (can be determined with [GLAES](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/glaes))
  - theo_wind: Theoretical potential of standardized wind turbines (can be determined with [GLAES](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/glaes))

The [ccg-spider](https://github.com/carderne/ccg-spider) repository can be used to combine different spatial data into standard H3 hexagons.

Once you have created a hexagon file with these features, create a `[COUNTRY ISO CODE]` folder inside the `data` folder and place the file titled `hex_final_[COUNTRY ISO CODE].geojson` inside. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `COUNTRY ISO CODE` is the country's ISO standard 2-letter abbreviation.

### (Optional) Hydropower files 
The hydropower files can be obtained by running the [Geo-X-data-prep](https://github.com/ClimateCompatibleGrowth/Geo-X-data-prep) repository and from the [HydroBASINS section of HydroSHEDS](https://www.hydrosheds.org/products/hydrobasins).

Create a `hydro` folder inside the `data/[COUNTRY ISO CODE]` folder and place the following files inside (you will need to rename one of the files to match the below requirement):
- `[COUNTRY ISO CODE]_hydropower_dams.gpkg`
- All the files from the HydroBASINS download (or the Shapefile cannot be used)

### (Optional) Geothermal GeoPackage file 
The geothermal GeoPackage file can be obtained by running the [Geo-X-data-prep](https://github.com/ClimateCompatibleGrowth/Geo-X-data-prep) repository.

Create a `geothermal` folder inside the `data/[COUNTRY ISO CODE]` folder and place the following file inside (you will need to rename it to match the following format):
- `[COUNTRY ISO CODE]_geothermal_plants.gpkg`

## 2) Prepare input parameter Excel files
Next, prepare the techno-economic input parameter spreadsheets.
Required input parameters include the spatial area of interest, total annual demand for the commodity, and prices and cost of capital for infrastructure investments.
These values can be either current values or projected values for a single snapshot in time.
The parameter values for running the model can be specified in a set of Excel and CSV files in the `parameters` folder. All files should be checked to ensure correct set up.

- **Basic plant:** The `basic_[COMMODITY ABBREVIATION]_plant` folder contains several CSV files with global parameters for optimizing the plant design.
    - All power units are MW, and all energy units are MWh.
    - The `generators.csv` file **must only include** the generators that you wish to use in the optimisation.

For more information on these parameters, refer to the [PyPSA documentation](https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `COMMODITY ABBREVIATION` can be 'h2' or 'nh3' for currently implemented commodities. 

- **Conversion parameters:** `conversion_parameters.xlsx` includes parameters related to converting between states of the commodity. This is only needed in the `hydrogen` folder.

- **Country parameters:** `country_parameters.xlsx` includes country- and technology-specific interest rates, heat and electricity costs, and asset lifetimes.
    - Interest rates should be expressed as a decimal (e.g. 5% as 0.05).
    - Asset lifetimes should be in years.
    - The file can contain columns related to generators not being considered.

- **Demand parameters:** `demand_parameters.xlsx` includes a list of demand centers. 
For each demand center, its lat-lon location, annual demand, and commodity state for that demand must be specified.

- **Pipeline parameters:** `pipeline_parameters.xlsx` includes the price, capacity, and lifetime data for different sizes of pipeline.

- **Technology parameters:** `technology_parameters.xlsx` includes water parameters, road infrastructure parameters, and whether road and pipeline construction is allowed.

- **Transport parameters:** `transport_parameters.xlsx` includes the parameters related to road transport of the commodity, including truck speed, cost, lifetime, and capacity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Excel files must be kept in a sub-folder titled with the commodity name and that sub-folder should be within another folder titled with the respective Country ISO Code. 
> As currently implemented, the commodity must be either `hydrogen` or `ammonia`.
> For the illustrative case of Namibia, we have them in a folder titled `NA` with two sub-folders `hydrogen` and `ammonia`.

# Running Geo-X with Snakemake
Once you've done the repository setup and prepared your input data, you're ready to run Geo-X!

This repository uses [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to automate its workflow (for a gentle introduction to Snakemake, see [Getting Started with Snakemake](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/workflows-snakemake/) on The Carpentries Incubator).

## 1) Modify the config file

High-level workflow settings are controlled in the config file: `config.yaml`.

**Wildcards:** 

These are used in the `scenario` section of the config file to specify the data used in the workflow.

They can be changed to match the case you're analysing. They are: 
- `country`: an ISO standard 2-letter abbreviation
- `weather_year`: a 4-digit year between 1940 and 2023 included in the ERA5 dataset
- `plant_type`: the commodity to be produced (currently either "hydrogen" or "ammonia")

**Weather data:**

The amount of years you want to download weather data for should be added into `years_to_check`.

For instance, if you want your weather data to start in 2015 and span five years, `weather_year` should be 2015 and `years_to_check` should be 5.

You can set the frequency of data to be used in optimisation using `freq` (i.e., "1H" for hourly, "3H" for three-hourly, etc.)

**Generators:**

The types of renewable generators considered for plant construction are included in the `generators_dict` section. Currently, only `solar`, `wind`, `hydro`, and `geothermal` can be considered. Ensure that all the generators that you are considering are in the dictionary and remove any unnecessary ones.

Dependent on which generators you are using, you can change the `panel` value for solar and the `turbine` value for wind.

In the `gen_capacity` section, you will find `solar` and `wind`, `hydro`, and `geothermal`, where the values can be changed to match the values that you are analysing.

**Efficiency of generator plants:**Â 

Both `hydro` and `geothermal` efficiencies can be set here as necessary.

**Other:**

You will have to set the `solver` to the solver name that you are going to be using. 

You will also have to set whether a `water_limit` is `True` or `False` (i.e., whether you want to consider water scarcity in your process).

In the `transport` section, `pipeline_construction` and `road_construction` can be switched from `True` to `False`, as needed.

Lastly, specify the `currency` used in most of your parameter files. For example, in `technology_parameters.xlsx`, under the `Water` sheet, there is a row titled `Water specific cost (euros/m3)`. You can edit this to reflect the desired currency, but ensure that you also update the `currency` value accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> `country` and `weather_year` can be a list of more than one, depending on how many countries and years you are analysing.
> You must ensure all other input files that are needed for each country are where they should be, as previously described.

## 2) Run Geo-X rules

Geo-X requires that you run it using Snakemake by entering rule names in the terminal. 
When you do this, Snakemake will run all the necessary rules to achieve the rule you entered and create the desired output.
Rules are defined in the `Snakefile`.

Snakemake requires a specification of the `NUMBER OF CORES TO BE USED` when you run a rule. This can be up to 4.

Each rule has a different expected run time:
- The `get_weather_data` rule, depending on country size and your internet connection, could take from a few minutes to several hours to run. 
Ensure that you have space on your computer to store the data, which can be several GB.
- The `optimize_plant` rule, depending on country size and the number of demand centers, could take from several minutes to several hours to run.
- The `optimize_transport` rule, depending on country size, should take a few minutes to run. 
- All other rules take a few seconds to run.

### 1) Get weather data (if needed)

If you already have weather data for your area of interest, just use step 2!
If not, you need to run the weather data rule, which will download the data you need from the CDS API: 

```
snakemake -j [NUMBER OF CORES TO BE USED] run_weather
```

### 2) Run optimization or mapping rules

Finally, run the Geo-X optimization process. 
These rules are used to run the whole process without having to go through each rule step-by-step.
If any input files are changed after a completed run, the same command can be used again and Snakemake will only run the necessary scripts to ensure the results are up to date.

Make sure you have the necessary weather file(s) in the `cutouts` folder before running, titled `[COUNTRY ISO CODE]_[WEATHER YEAR].nc` for each country.

The total commodity cost for all scenarios can be run by entering the following rule into the terminal.
```
snakemake -j [NUMBER OF CORES TO BE USED] optimise_all
```
Similarly, you can map commodity costs for all scenarios with the following rule:
```
snakemake -j [NUMBER OF CORES TO BE USED] map_all
```
___
# Definitions of all rules

While all rules are discussed here for completeness, **you do not need to enter each rule one-by-one**. 
You can simply run one of the optimization or mapping rules, and Snakemake will ensure that all required rules are completed to achieve this. 
Please refer to the steps in the previous section for most usages.

> [!NOTE]
> `PLANT TYPE` is the commodity to be produced (currently either "hydrogen" or "ammonia").

### `get_weather_data` rule
This will download weather data from your area of interest for generation optimization.
```
snakemake -j [NUMBER OF CORES TO BE USED] run_weather
```

### `optimize_transport` rule
This will calculate the cost of the optimal commodity transportation strategy from each hexagon to each demand center, using both pipelines and road transport, and parameters from `technology_parameters.xlsx`, `demand_parameters.xlsx`, and `country_parameters.xlsx`. This will also take into account the costs for conversion needed for hydrogen to a different demand state.
```
snakemake -j [NUMBER OF CORES TO BE USED] resources/hex_transport_[COUNTRY ISO CODE]_[PLANT TYPE].geojson
```

### `calculate_water_costs` rule
This will calculate water costs from the ocean and freshwater bodies for commodity production in each hexagon using `parameters/technology_parameters.xlsx` and `parameters/country_parameters.xlsx`.
```
snakemake -j [NUMBER OF CORES TO BE USED] resources/hex_water_[COUNTRY ISO CODE]_[PLANT TYPE].geojson
```

### `optimize_plant` rule
This will design a plant to meet the commodity demand profile for each demand center, accounting for each transportation method to each demand center. 
Ensure that you have specified your plant parameters in the `parameters/basic_[COMMODITY ABBREVIATION]_plant` folder, and your demand centers in `parameters/demand_parameters.xlsx`.
```
snakemake -j [NUMBER OF CORES TO BE USED] resources/hex_lc_[COUNTRY ISO CODE]_[WEATHER YEAR]_[PLANT TYPE].geojson
```

### `calculate_total_cost` rule
This will combine results to find the lowest-cost method of producing, transporting, and converting the commodity for each demand center.
```
snakemake -j [NUMBER OF CORES TO BE USED] results/hex_total_cost_[COUNTRY ISO CODE]_[WEATHER YEAR]_[PLANT TYPE].geojson
```

### `calculate_cost_components` rule
This will calculate the cost for each type of equipment in each polygon.
```
snakemake -j [NUMBER OF CORES TO BE USED] results/hex_cost_components_[COUNTRY ISO CODE]_[WEATHER YEAR]_[PLANT TYPE].geojson
```

### `calculate_map_costs` rule
This will visualize the spatial variation in different costs per kilogram of commodity.
```
snakemake -j [NUMBER OF CORES TO BE USED] plots/[COUNTRY ISO CODE]_[WEATHER YEAR]_[PLANT TYPE]
```

# Limitations

This model considers only greenfield generation. 
Therefore, it does not consider using grid electricity or existing generation. 
The model further assumes that all excess electricity is curtailed.

While the design of the commodity plant is convex and therefore guaranteed to find the global optimum solution if it exists, the selection of the trucking strategy is greedy to avoid the long computation times and potential computational intractability associated with a mixed-integer optimization problem.

Currently, only land transport is considered in the model. 
To calculate the cost of commodity production for export, any additional costs for conversion and transport via ship or undersea pipeline must be added in post-processing.

Transport costs are calculated from the center of the hexagon to the demand center. 
When using large hexagon sizes, this assumption may over- or underestimate transportation costs significantly. 
Additionally, only path length is considered when calculating the cost of road and pipeline construction. 
Additional costs due to terrain are not considered.
